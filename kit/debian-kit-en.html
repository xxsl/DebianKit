  <body><h1>Debian Kit for Android</h1><p>This kit installs a full version of
  Debian or Ubuntu on your Android phone or tablet. Key features are:</p><ul>
      <li>Debian and Android side-by-side - your Android device works as usual
      but you can unleash the power of Debian / Ubuntu on demand.</li>

      <li>Easy installation, provided that you have a fast Internet connection
      and you are familiar with Linux command lines to some extent.</li>

      <li>You can use a compiler, install a GUI (e.g. LXDE), and run any
      software that is offered by Debian / Ubuntu including command line
      driven daemons as well as GUI software.</li>

      <li>The kit is accompanied by a small software repository that contains
      e.g. a daemon that updates Debian's <q>/etc/resolv.conf</q> file from
      the Android <q>net.dns</q> property.</li>

      <li>The kit runs on different hardware, i.e. armel and i386
      architectures are supported. You can use a loop disk file (up to 2 Gb)
      as well as an extra partition on an external SD card (up to 32 Gb).</li>

      <li>The Debian system does not run in a chroot jail, it's installed
      side-by-side to Android instead. With this, all Android files / mounts
      are also accessible from Debian.</li>

      <li>Easy un-installation: the pre-installed Android software on your
      device is not altered seriously and you can get rid of this stuff if you
      are done. No flashing, no system extensions, no hassles.</li>
    </ul><p><b>Tip</b>: Instead RTFM, you may also watch H.264 screen casts.
  Either <a
  href="http://sven-ola.dyndns.org/repo/debian-kit.mp4">debian-kit.mp4</a>
  (3 Mb, shows basic installation of Debian Squeeze with openssh-server) or <a
  href="http://sven-ola.dyndns.org/repo/debian-kit-office.mp4">debian-kit-office.mp4</a>
  (12 Mb, Ubuntu Precise with LXDE, Firefox, and LibreOffice). Also, theres a
  <a href="market://details?id=org.dyndns.sven_ola.debian_kit">Debian Kit
  app</a> on Google play now that keeps you informed about updates, checks for
  showstoppers and displays this page.</p><p><b>Notes</b>: There are similar
  projects out there that may better match your needs, hardware, or taste.
  Specifically, Gaël's <a
  href="http://android.galoula.com/en/LinuxInstall/">Linux Installer</a> and
  Zachary's <a href="http://linuxonandroid.blogspot.co.uk/">Linux on
  Android</a> projects are visible via Google Play. Also, the kit's sources
  are hosted as a <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/debian-kit/">SourceForge Project</a>
  now.</p><h2><a name="Prereqisites">Prerequisites</a></h2><p>There are
  moderate prerequisites your Android device should met. The prerequisites are
  also checked by the installation script. You simply cannot continue if
  something is wrong.</p><ul>
      <li>Root access to your Android device is required. No root, no
      Debian.</li>

      <li>Kernel supports mounting loop disks or you have at least an external
      SD card with a spare partition.</li>

      <li>Kernel supports the ext2, ext3, or ext4 file systems.</li>

      <li>CPU architecture is ARM (little endian) or i386 (ia-32 bit).</li>

      <li>128 Mb of RAM or more, otherwise the launcher app may be killed
      during installation.</li>

      <li>512 Mb of free space on SD card (either internal or external).</li>

      <li>Internet connection to download 100-500 Mb of software
      packages.</li>

      <li>Terminal app installed, alternatively ADB access.</li>

      <li>If you are a noob: command line input and text file editing is a
      must.</li>
    </ul><p><b>WARNING</b>: This stuff is checked on different hardware. The
  kit should run with stock factory firmware, but customized ROMs should work
  also. Nevertheless: root access always includes the chance to do something
  very fatal to your device. Always watch, read and dig the error messages (if
  any) and re-think twice before doing something nasty.</p><h2><a

      Examples: enter <kbd>0s</kbd> for a minimal Debian Squeeze or enter
      <kbd>2p</kbd> for a maximum size Ubuntu Precise. Enter nothing to leave
      the autorun wizard now, e.g. to run the installation manually (see <a

      shows up now. Otherwise, a loop disk file is created and formatted which
      needs some minutes. After this, the first stage of the Debian
      installation starts downloading packages. You may need to prevent your
      device from sleeping in order to keep the Internet connection
      alive.</dd>

      <dd>The autorun wizard is still active. This means, that after
      successfully completing the first stage of the Debian installation, the
      second stage starts automatically by checking the installation media and
      completing the setup. In case of errors, you need to re-start manually
      (see <a href="#ManualInstall">Manual Installation</a> section
      below).</dd>

      <dd>If the second stage succeeds, the autorun wizard finishes by
      starting the <q>clean</q> script that in turn asks you for a
      confirmation. Enter <kbd>yes</kbd> and confirm with [enter] to remove
      all files that are only required during installation. This saves
      valuable space on your Android's <q>/data</q> partition, thus leaving
      more space to install apps. If you also don't plan to use the static
      OpenVpn binary that comes with the kit, you can save even more space by
      entering <kbd>ovpn</kbd> instead. Enter <kbd>q</kbd> to abort cleaning,
      e.g. if you plan to re-read the docs, contribute to the kit, or create
      another Debian installation later on.</dd>

      width="80" />Step 9)</dt>

      <dd>After finishing the autorun wizard, the Debian disk is unmounted and
      you will see the Android shell's hash prompt again. Typically, a small
      <q>deb</q> script was added during installation to the
      <q>/system/bin</q> directory. This is available to activate Debian on
      demand now. Enter <kbd>deb</kbd> and confirm with [enter]. This will
      mount the Debian loop disk file / SD card partition and you find
      yourself on a root bash shell ready to start typing in Debian
      commands.</dd>

      <dd>In the bash root shell, type <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> and
      <kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd> to get the latest security updates. Also
      enter <kbd>apt-get install andromize</kbd> to install a package that
      adds Android specific user groups, changes some defaults for the
      <q>adduser</q> command, and pulls in <q>androresolvd</q> - a small
      daemon that queries the Android <q>net.dns1</q> property that in turn
      updates the <q>/etc/resolv.conf</q> file if your network connection
      changes. It also prevents Debian's <q>hal</q> package from being
      installed later on, because this oopses the Android GUI.</dd>
    </dl><p>Basically you are done now. You may type <kbd>exit</kbd> to leave
  Debian's bash shell, type <kbd>deb u</kbd> to unmount the Debian loop disk
  file / SD card partition, and close the ConnectBot terminal to end the
  installation session.</p><h2><a name="ManualInstall">Manual
  Installation</a></h2><p>In some cases, you may need to skip the autorun
  wizard and run the installation manually after unpacking the kit. To do so,
  enter <kbd>/data/local/deb/mk-debian</kbd>. Add parameters as desired and
  check settings by adding <kbd>-h</kbd> as the last switch. Confirm with
  [enter] to start the command. Here are some examples:</p><table border="1">

      </tr>
    </table><p>Retype the desired <kbd>mk-debian</kbd> command and omit the
  <kbd>-h</kbd> switch to execute the installation. This will create the
  destination file system and start the first stage of the Debian installation
  using the included debootstrap scripts. After this, the Android system
  partition is mounted RW in order to add a shortcut symlink
  (<q>/system/bin/deb</q>).</p><p>If adding the <q>deb</q> symlink succeeds,
  you can start the second stage of the Debian installation with the
  <kbd>deb</kbd> shortcut. Otherwise, enter <kbd>/data/local/deb/deb</kbd> and
  confirm with [enter]. If the second stage completes, a root bash shell is
  started. Continue as described above and enter <kbd>apt-get update; apt-get
  upgrade; apt-get install andromize</kbd>.</p><p><b>Note</b>: if the first
  stage fails, you need to restart with <kbd>mk-debian</kbd>. If the second
  stage fails, it is sufficient to unmount with <kbd>deb u</kbd> and restart
  with <kbd>deb</kbd>.</p><p>Installing to a loop disk file is easy and
  secure, thus recommended as the default. However, due to the disk file size
  limits of the vfat file system, you cannot create loop disk files larger
  that 2047 Mb. To overcome this limit, you can install to a disk partition
  also. Most Android devices support external SD cards up to 32 Gb, some even
  support USB host mode where you can attach an external hard disk. Add the
  desired devices file name, e.g. start <kbd>mk-debian -i /dev/block/XXX</kbd>
  to install to a disk partition. In this case the UUID of the created file
  system is written as <q>IMG=uuid:xxx</q> line into the <q>bootdeb</q> script
  in order to find the installation medium later on e.g. if you unplug / eject
  the USB disk and insert it later to another USB port.</p><p>In difference to
  Debian, Android block devices are available under the <q>/dev/block</q>
  directory. Also, on some devices, there may be no standard
  <q>/dev/block/sdX</q> device file names. You may check, what devices the
  Android auto-mount daemon has found with <kbd>ls -l
  /dev/block/devices/vold</kbd> before starting <kbd>mk-debian</kbd>. The
  Android vold auto-mounter works with block device numbers, e.g. 179:9 is the
  first partition and 179:8 is the partition table on the second NAND flash
  device. You can start the busybox fdisk program with
  <kbd>/data/local/deb/armel/busybox fdisk -l /dev/block/XXX</kbd> to list
  partitions on an external SD card or USB drive. If unsure which device holds
  the partition data, you should transfer the SD card / USB drive to your PC
  and change the partition layout there.</p><p><b>WARNING</b>: Do not try to
  add partitions on the internal SD card, because typically only a
  non-standard partition table exists on the device and you may seriously
  destroy your ROM / firmware with this.</p><h2><a name="Notes">Notes and
  Hints</a></h2><p>The rest of the show is Debian / Ubuntu command line magic
  and depends on what you want to do. You may clean downloaded files in
  <q>/var/cache/apt/archives</q> with <kbd>apt-get clean</kbd>. This will
  remove the package files downloaded during installation. To end the Debian
  session, type <kbd>exit</kbd> to leave the bash shell and <kbd>deb u</kbd>
  to unmount the Debian disk. If this does not work, type <kbd>deb k</kbd> to
  kill stray Debian processes before unmounting. Type <kbd>deb h</kbd> to show
  more options of the <q>deb</q> script. Type <kbd>deb</kbd> to re-enter the
  bash shell.</p><p>You should add a normal user account, e.g. enter
  <kbd>adduser yourlogin</kbd> on the Debian bash shell. If the
  <q>andromize</q> package is installed, the new user account is automatically
  added to some Android specific user groups that grants e.g. Internet and
  SD-card access - these groups correspond to the access rights you need to
  confirm when installing new apps. You may enter <kbd>apt-get install sudo
  openssh-server</kbd> and <kbd>adduser yourlogin sudo</kbd> to be able to
  start the openssh server, login via ssh and elevate from there to the root
  account. Inside the ssh session, you may encounter <q>locale</q> messages.
  Type <kbd>sudo apt-get install locales</kbd>. With Debian use <kbd>sudo
  dpkg-reconfigure locales</kbd> to select your preferred language (do
  <kbd>echo $LANG</kbd> if to view the current setting). With Ubuntu <kbd>sudo
  locale-gen $LANG</kbd> will do the same. You can use <kbd>deb s</kbd> to
  start, and <kbd>deb S</kbd> to stop the openssh server from the Android
  shell later on. </p><p>Lets start to have some fun. On the root bash shell,
  type <kbd>apt-get install andromize-lxde</kbd>. This will install a memory
  based X-server that provides a GUI login via RDP (aka. Windows Remote
  Desktop / Terminal Server) as well as a number of packages that form the
  LXDE desktop shell. During the installation, some query dialogs may show up.
  Tap on the screen, tap on the <code>[ctrl]</code> button now displayed and
  press / tap [i] to highlight the dialog's <code>OK</code> button. Press /
  tap [space] to accept the default. Do some cleanup after this: <kbd>apt-get
  autoremove</kbd> and <kbd>apt-get clean</kbd>. Note, that the
  <q>andromize-lxde</q> package replaces the standard <q>vnc4server</q>
  package with <q>tightvncserver</q> to circumvent a bug in this context and
  that the standard Xorg server is not necessary here. Also, the <q>xrdp</q>
  user is added to the <q>inet</q> group, otherwise the XRDP daemon cannot
  access the network. You can use <kbd>deb x</kbd> to start, and <kbd>deb
  X</kbd> to stop the openssh server from the Android shell later on.

    </table><p>After installing <q>andromize-lxde</q> package, you should be
  able to login via RDP from your favorite RDP app or from the PC / laptop's
  <q>remote desktop</q> application using the username / password of the user
  account you created earlier. For this, you may install the Remote RDP app
  (<a href="market://details?id=org.toremote.rdpdemo">Lite</a> or <a
  href="market://details?id=org.toremote.serversmanager">Pro</a> version from
  Walter Yongtao Wang available on Google Play). Add a new session within this
  app: localhost, yourlogin, colors=24 bits, legacy-RDP-mode=on. Test the
  setup. If this works, e.g. <kbd>sudo apt-get install openoffice.org</kbd>
  will get you a complete office suite :)</p><p>As a programmer, who
  frequently uses the kit with a foreign external keyboard (USB or bluetooth),
  you may want to adapt the English keyboard layout to match the keyboard
  layout you are accustomed to. Install and configure the <a
  href="market://details?id=com.apedroid.hwkeyboardhelper">External Keyboard
  Helper</a> app for this.</p><p>On some devices, nothing can be added to
  Android's <q>/system</q> directory. You may use the autorun feature of your
  terminal app (ConnectBot: <code>Post-login automation</code>) to add a
  command like <kbd>export PATH=/data/local/deb:$PATH</kbd> in order to run
  Debian with the <kbd>deb</kbd> command.</p><p>The hostname displayed on the
  bash prompt is fetched from Android's net.hostname property. Most likely
  it's an ugly hex ID, that you may change to a more telling name. On the root
  bash shell enter <kbd>echo "myname" &gt; /etc/hostname &amp;&amp; hostname
  $(cat /etc/hostname)</kbd> for this.</p><p>With Ubuntu (Lynx or Precise), a
  new technique called <q>Upstart</q> is used to start and stop jobs while
  with Debian, scripts below <q>/etc/init.d</q> are used for starting and
  stopping daemons. For this reason, a small replacement exists that simulates
  the <q>initctl</q> command of Ubuntu's upstart which at least works with the
  ssh daemon. I got permission from Peter to use his <a
  href="http://forum.aokp.co/topic/49-how-can-i-run-aokp-in-emulator/">Python
  initctl replacement</a> that offers more features, but decided against it in
  order to stay with ash scripts in the kit.</p><p>If you want to use Debian's
  OpenVpn packet, you need a tun.ko kernel module. Most customized ROMs
  include a working tun.ko module and I have collected a number of tun.ko
  modules that will be loaded automatically by the <q>bootdeb</q> script if
  your kernel version matches. Also, a symlink <q>/dev/net/tun</q> -&gt;
  <q>/dev/tun</q> is created for compatibility. However, the <a
  href="market://details?id=de.schaeuffelhut.android.openvpn">OpenVpn
  Settings</a> app is more convenient if you only want to connect as road
  warrior to an OpenVpn server. For me, the <q>OpenVpn Installer</q> app does
  not do the right thing. For this reason, the kit includes a static OpenVpn
  binary. In the <q>OpenVpn settings</q> app, change the OpenVpn file name
  setting to <q>/data/local/deb/openvpn</q> for this. If you are a
  security-junkie, check out and re-play the OpenWrt build instructions for
  all binaries in the <q>devel/readme-openwrt.txt</q> file.</p><p>To create
  you own kernel modules matching the Android kernel version, you cannot
  simply do <kbd>apt-get install linux-headers</kbd>, because the Debian /
  Ubuntu archives do not offer packages for your Android kernel version. For
  this reason, the DKMS kernel module compiling system does not run which in
  turn is required to install some packages (e.g. the VirtualBox package that
  otherwise is usable on Atom-x86 CPUs). If you are lucky, the ROM developer
  switched on the /proc/config.gz kernel configuration file which can be used
  to grab working linux-headers from a stock kernel. Refer to
  <q>devel/readme-dkms.txt</q> for details.</p><p>To remove the kit from your
  Android device later on, start a root shell and enter
  <kbd>/data/local/deb/uninstall</kbd>. After this, do not forget to remove
  the <q>debian.img</q> file from your SD-Card, e.g. by using a file manager
  app.</p><p>The kit does not use the <q>chroot</q> command to make up a
  separate Debian environment (refer to <a
  href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/schroot">schroot(1)</a> for a similar
  technique). Instead, Debian subdirectories and files (such as <q>/lib</q> or
  <q>/etc/resolv.conf</q>) are added to the Android RAM-disk based file system
  with symlinks or bind-mounts. With this, e.g. you have access to newly
  mounted devices such as USB drives and the SD card. Also, can use Debian
  commands to compile packages that in turn can use a working <q>chroot</q>.
  This works, because a typical Android device has a file system (e.g.
  Libraries below <q>/system/lib</q>) that does not overlap the Debian file
  system (e.g. Libraries below <q>/lib</q> and <q>/usr/lib</q>). However, some
  files may overlap - which triggers a warning displayed if you start the
  <q>deb</q> script. For example, the Android <q>/etc/hosts</q> file is
  replaced by the Debian version while Debian is mounted. Which in turn may
  influence the inner working of your Android software stack. This is
  especially true with custom ROMs, because these typically add some Linux
  stuff that the ROM developer may miss. All changes are reverted if you issue
  the <kbd>deb u</kbd> command or simply by restarting your device.</p><p>Some
  custom ROMs tend to add more and more GNU/Linux software (busybox,
  libc-insmod, libc-iptables...). Specifically they may require the /etc and
  /lib symlinks pointing to /system/etc and /system/lib, which conflicts with
  the merging concept as described above. Typically, the /etc and /lib
  symlinks are not required by Android software and thus ignored when merging
  in Debian's directory structure. If you suspect this to trigger misbehavior,
  you may issue <kbd>export CUSTOM_ROM=true</kbd> before starting
  <code>deb</code> to also merge /etc and /lib.</p><p>If you upgrade/change
  your Android ROM, typically the debian.img file on the SD card isn't lost.
  However, you may miss the <code>deb</code> link and also, there may be stray
  symlinks in your Debian file system pointing back to now non-existing files.
  Download and unpack the <code>debian-kit*.shar</code> file, run
  <kbd>/data/local/deb/mk-debian -u</kbd> to re-create the <code>deb</code>
  link and <kbd>deb c</kbd> to remove all backpointing symlinks (they will be
  re-created on the next turn).</p><h2><a name="Proposals">Proposed
  Features</a></h2><p>Nothing is perfect - so here's a list of ideas for the
  next versions of the kit:</p><ul>
      <li>Add package that extracts Linux-kernel-headers for installed Android
      kernel that's used with DKMS.</li>

      <li>Add binaries for Android-on-Mips, only unpack files for current arch
      to save space.</li>

      <li>Automatically install <q>debianize</q> package at end of second
      stage.</li>

      <li>Enhance start / stop: user-autorun script, maybe autorun Debian
      during Android startup.</li>

      <li>Dbus integration e.g. for clipboard exchange between Android and
      Debian, run KDE4 / Gnome3 / Unity desktops.</li>

      <li>Integrating the pulseaudio sound system with Xrdp.</li>

      <li>Cleanup of old files in <q>/tmp</q>, <q>/var/tmp</q>, or
      <q>/var/log</q> (maybe Debian-cron-based).</li>

      <li>Feature to prepare loop disk / partition on PC, later transferred to
      phone / tablet.</li>

      <li>Check if it's possible to use yaffs2 instead of ext2 / 3 / 4 for the
      file system.</li>

      <li>Add script to securely saving files from external SD card in order
      to create 2nd partition.</li>
    </ul><pre>Have fun!
